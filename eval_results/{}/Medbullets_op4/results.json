On physical exam, the child is in no acute distress and appears developmentally appropriate for her age. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with a soft, 1 cm bulge at the umbilicus. The bulge increases in size when the child cries and can be easily reduced inside the umbilical ring without apparent pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
